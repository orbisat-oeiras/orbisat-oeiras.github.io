My last post was three months ago. So, where have I been? In short, I was very busy with school.

In May and June, I had to focus most of my time on studying, so I didn't have much time to work on anything related to programming. But now it's my summer break, so I have a lot more free time. That means I'll be getting back to my usual schedule of posting every other Friday. But since I'm already talking about the current state of this blog, I might as well take this chance to tell you about my plans for the future.

Firstly, this post isn't coming alone! On Monday, I'll be posting about the GMTK Game Jam, so keep your eyes peeled! After that, I intend to get back to working on my game, so the devlogs will definitely be coming back.

As for the physics simulation tutorials, while I definitely want to continue that project, I'm not sure if it'll be coming back so soon. However, let me now what you think in the comments section - should I just focus on the devlogs, or should I continue the physics series as well? (If you don't see the comments section at the bottom of the post, reload the page and it should appear - I'm not sure what's causing that, but I'll fix it someday!)

Further on, I've recently taken an interest on audio plugin development. I'm not sure if there'd be interest in posts about that though, so let me know if you'd like to read such posts in the comments.

Lastly, I'd also really like to participate in [SoME3](https://some.3b1b.co/), but I'm not sure I'll have enough time, mostly because I don't even know what to talk about. So, once again, I'm asking for your help: Do you know of a problem with an interesting or counter-intuitive solution? A branch of mathematics that's relevant to computer science? I'm looking for something that's related to computer science, since that's what I cover in this blog, so if you have an idea you think might yield a good submission, leave it the comments below.

That's mostly it for what I have planned in terms of content. But, before you leave, I've got some more news for you. I have a brand new newsletter! Right above the comments section, you should find a form to subscribe - just submit your email and you'll get notifications straight to your inbox whenever I make a new post!

Alright, that's it for today. As always, thanks for reading and goodbye!
